# gcp-dbt
Showcases a professional data pipeline architecture using GCP services. Ingests data from REST and streaming APIs, processes it via Dataflow, using Cloud Storage as Datalake, transforms it with dbt Core on Cloud Run, and loads it into BigQuery as Datawarehouse for analysis in Looker Studio. Orchestration is managed with Cloud Composer (Airflow).
